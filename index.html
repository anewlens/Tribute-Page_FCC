        <p>That's what the graffiti proclaimed in England, a testament to the command of both skill and admiration Eric Clapton wielded in the 60's. In the wildfire that was the early days of Rock n Roll, Clapton burned brightest, starting out breaking strings on stage with the Yardbirds. His sharp rise to fame through bands like Cream and Derek and the Dominoes cemented as the premier guitarist on the planet and laid the foundation for him to become a self-sustainable solo artist through the 80's, 90's and through the next millenium.</p>
